# nebulizer
A granular synthesizer that you can play on your computer!

Here's a video of me fiddling around with it:

Only usable as a standalone MIDI instrument at the moment.
In the future I'd like to make this usable as a DAW plugin, but it seems like that will require a major refactor so it might be a while before I get around to it.

For now, though, you can play with nebulizer using a MIDI keyboard or some sort of livecoding sequencer like ORCA or TidalCycles.
